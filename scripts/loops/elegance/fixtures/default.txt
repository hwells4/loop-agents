# Elegance Review - Mock Response

## Exploration
Explored the codebase looking for simplification opportunities.

## Findings
1. Found 2 functions that could be merged
2. Identified unused abstraction in utils/
3. Discovered opportunity to simplify error handling

## Subagents Spawned
- Pattern analyzer: found 3 similar code blocks
- Complexity reviewer: flagged 1 over-engineered service

## Progress Update
Appended findings to progress file.

FINDINGS:
- utils/helper.ts has 3 near-duplicate functions → candidate for consolidation
- ErrorHandler class wraps simple try/catch → may be unnecessary abstraction
- Config loading could use single source instead of 3 files

PLATEAU: false
REASONING: Found several opportunities worth investigating. More exploration needed in services/ directory.
